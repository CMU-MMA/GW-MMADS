## Notes

We accidentally chose pointings without templates for the first night (230922); it is not known whether this is a problem with our custom .tess/.ref files or with gwemopt itself.
It does seem to be a problem that manifests in DELVE fields in particular (not in DES or DECaLS).
The DECam jsons used for these nights have the suffix `.230922.json`.
