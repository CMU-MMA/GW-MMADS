Our trigger is for the first 40 minutes of the night.
We have two targets:
    - Epoch 5 (final) for S240925n; 90s in i+z (8 pointings for i, 9 pointings for z)
    - Another long-term follow-up epoch for S230922g; 60s in g, 80s in i (one pointing each)

S240925n is a setting field and at airmass ~1.5 at the beginning of the night, and accordingly should be observed first.
To assist with this the observer may request that the operator point the telescope at the first pointing after initial checks/twilight fields to save on slew time.
