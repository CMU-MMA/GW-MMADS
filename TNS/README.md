## TNS Reporting

To run this you need two files:
1) DECam_Candidate_Summary.csv from pipeline 
2) File with columns 'Transient	Remarks	AT_Type' where Transient column is the name of transients to report from the DECam_Candidate_Summary.csv file. The other two columns can be left blank.

This process should be improved to save time and remove redundancy or the possibility of mistakes. It would be ideal to host on NERSC/Vera (to avoid having to download the DECam_Candidate_Summary.csv file).
