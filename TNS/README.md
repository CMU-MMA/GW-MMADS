## TNS Reporting

Retrieved the SourcesASSOC.csv file from /DECAM/SEARCH/2023-09-24/... (or similar) and retrieved the list of saved sources on Fritz (download as a .csv and delete rows corresponding to objects that we do not want to report). Then this script will work.

This process should be improved to save time and remove redundancy or the possibility of mistkaes. It would be ideal to host on NERSC/Vera (to avoid having to download the large SourcesASSOC.csv file) but that still requires downloading a file from Fritz at present.
